# Syntax
  we are going to talk about sytax .now every language in the world follows a set of rules, and Python is no different.
  if you try write something that python cannot understand ,Python will not be able to understand that.And that means Python will not able to excute that code.

  ```python
print('Hello World')
 Output : Hello World 

# Print is the inbuild fuction ,it will helps to excute the out put to out put cell the sytax is ( ) 
# in between paranthesse we need to give input or excution command

# Sytax error -- we have to ensure all the sytax proparelly.
print('Hello'

  Cell In[3], line 2
    print('Hello'
                 ^
SyntaxError: incomplete input
