# ⚙️ Setup the Environment  

In this tutorial, we are going to use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as our Python environment.  

---

## 1. Install VS Code 🖥️  
- Windows Users: You can get VS Code directly from the Microsoft Store, or download it from the official website.  
- 👉 [**Download VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user)  
- Follow the installation steps to complete setup.

## 2. Install Python Interpreter 🐍  
- Download and install the latest version of Python from the official site:  
- 👉 [**Download Python**](https://www.python.org/)  
- ✅ During installation, make sure to check the option **“Add Python to PATH.”**  

---

## 3. Install Extensions in VS Code 🔌  
- Open **VS Code**.  
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + X** → this opens the Extensions tab.  
- Search for **Python (official)** and install it.  
- Similarly, install the **Jupyter extension**.

## 4. Create a Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- Go to **File → New File** in VS Code.  
- Select **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** as the file type.  
- A new tab (e.g., `Untitled.ipynb`) will open.  
- This is where we will **write and run Python code interactively**.
