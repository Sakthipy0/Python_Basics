‚öôÔ∏è Setup the Environment

In this tutorial, we are going to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our development environment.

1. Install VS Code

    * Select Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) as the file type.
    * A new tab (e.g., Untitled.ipynb) will open.
    * his is where we will write and run our Python code interactively.
