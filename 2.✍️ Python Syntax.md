# ‚úçÔ∏è Python Syntax  

We are going to talk about **syntax**.  

**Python is case sensitive language!**

Every programming language follows a set of rules, and **Python is no different**.  
If you try to write something that Python cannot understand, it will raise an **error** and will not execute the code.  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Syntax Example  

```python
print('Hello World')
```
### Output:
```
Hello World
```

  * print is a built-in function in Python.
  * The syntax is print() ‚Üí parentheses () are required.
  * Inside the parentheses, we pass the text (called a string) or any expression we want to display.

## ‚ùå Syntax Error Example
```python
print('Hello'
```
### Error Output:
```python
Cell In[3], line 2
    print('Hello'
                 ^
SyntaxError: incomplete input
```
Here, Python shows a SyntaxError because the closing parenthesis ) is missing.

## üêç Common Beginner Syntax Errors

| Mistake                             | Example                          | Error Shown                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing parenthesis                 | `print 'Hello'`                  | `SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'` |
| Missing quotation mark              | `print("Hello)`                  | `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`      |
| Missing colon in control statements | `if x == 5`                      | `SyntaxError: expected ':'`                           |
| Wrong indentation                   | <pre>if True:\nprint("Hi")</pre> | `IndentationError: expected an indented block`        |
| Mixing quotes improperly            | `print('Hello")`                 | `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`      |

‚ö° Remember: Always check for

Parentheses ()

Quotes ' ' or " "

Colons : after loops/conditions

Proper indentation (spaces or tabs)

# üìù Python Comment Syntax  

Comments are lines in your code that **Python ignores** when executing.  
They are useful for:  
- Explaining code to humans üë©‚Äçüíª  
- Making notes or reminders  
- Temporarily disabling parts of code  

---

## 1. Single-line Comment  

In Python, a single-line comment starts with the `#` symbol.  

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello World")  # This prints Hello World
```
### Output:
```
Hello World
```
## 2. Multi-line Comment

Python doesn‚Äôt have a special multi-line comment syntax like some languages.
But you can use multiple # lines or a string (triple quotes) as a workaround.

```python
# This is line 1 of a comment
# This is line 2 of a comment
# This is line 3 of a comment

"""
This is another way to write
a multi-line comment using 
triple quotes (but technically it‚Äôs a string).
"""
print("Python Comments Example")
```
### Output:
```
Python Comments Example
```
## ‚ö° Best Practices for Comments

 * Use comments to explain WHY, not just WHAT.
 
 * Keep comments short and clear.
 
 * Don‚Äôt overuse comments for obvious code.
