# 🐍  Your First Python Code  

Hope you have completed all the steps from the **Setup Environment** tutorial.  
Now, you should have an **Untitled Jupyter Notebook** opened (like the image above).

## 📓 Understanding Jupyter Notebook Cells  
In Jupyter, work is done inside **cells**.  
There are two main types of cells:  

- **Code Cell** → Used to write and execute Python code.  
- **Markdown Cell** → Used to write text, notes, and explanations.  

---

## ➕ Creating a New Cell  
- Click on **`+ Code`** → This will create a new **Code Cell** below the current one.  
- You can add multiple cells and run them individually.  

---

## 🖥️ Writing Your First Python Program  
Inside the new **Code Cell**, type the following code:  

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Then press Shift + Enter (or click ▶ Run) to execute it.

## ✅ Output will be:
```
Hello, World!
```
