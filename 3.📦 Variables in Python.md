# 📦 Variables in Python
## 🔹 What is a Variable?
A variable is like a container 📦 that stores data in memory.
It has:

 - Name → identifier you give it

 - Value → the data it stores

## 🔹 Creating a Variable
```python
x = 10
name = "Python"
price = 99.5

print(x)
print(name)
print(price)
```
### 👉 Output:
```
10
Python
99.5
```
## 🔹 Rules for Naming Variables
✅ Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
✅ Can contain letters, numbers, underscores
✅ Case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are different)
❌ Cannot use spaces or special symbols (@, $, %, #)
❌ Cannot use Python keywords (if, for, while, etc.)
### Example:
```python
# Valid
my_var = 100
_age = 25
Name1 = "Alice"

# Invalid ❌
1num = 50
my-var = 60
for = "loop"
```
## 🔹 Multiple Assignments
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)   # 1 2 3

x = y = z = 10
print(x, y, z)   # 10 10 10
```
## 🔹 Dynamic Typing (Python Feature)
Python variables don’t need a fixed type. You can change it anytime.
```python
var = 10        # integer
var = "Python"  # now string
var = 9.9       # now float

print(var)
```
### 👉 Output:
```
9.9
```
## 🔹 Constants (By Convention)

Python doesn’t have real constants, but we use UPPERCASE to indicate a value shouldn’t change.
```python
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
```
## ✅ Quick Practice

Create a variable for your name and print it.

Store your age and print it.

Assign three numbers in one line and print them.

Try giving an invalid variable name and see what error you get.
